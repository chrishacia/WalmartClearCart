## Additional Note

In no way, shape or form. Is this or am I affiliated or associated with Walmart. I am merely a person who shops on the website sometimes. Who sometimes also ends up with a full cart that I don't end up getting for one reason or another. Then later come back to get something different, maybe just a single item or two. Only to be faced with a cart I left behind and no means of just quickly emptying it to buy the other items I want in that moment. Often leaving the site to find the same items elsewhere cause I have to manually click through removing all items from my cart before I can buy what I want in that moment, which is tedious and annoying. In my search to find out if there was a way to do this easier, I found that there were a lot of other people similarly annoyed by the lack of ability to empty their carts, or save them for later all or in full. I didn't find any means of doing either, so I made this. Please again be mindful of the risks mentioned above.

## Additional Additional Note

This isn't perfect, I made it on a whim, in a short while. If you have idea's for improving it, fork it, and share the change via pull request.
